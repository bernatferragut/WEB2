# LZRBIT - GALAXIES PAINTER WEB APP

## What is LZRBIT?

The LZRBIT is a drawing-app designed to create web-art using the BBC Microbit microcontroller as a joystick.

Art works are created by using the microbit accelerometer BLE service - Bluetooth Low Energy- paired with the Chrome browser.

## The conceptual design

After teaching kids how to use the Microbit for a couple of years I tried to answer the following question?

**What sort of web application would develop an artist with the Microbit?**

As a media artist I thought to create a very simple and minimal app where we could ‘feel’ the Microbit gyroscope and use as an advantage, the discreet packaged information the Bluetooth Low Energy sends to create an ‘electric’ style only possible through this type of radio communication.

## The user experience design - UX

Although simple in its design, the Microbit/Chrome browser experience becomes a new artistic medium where ‘Galaxies’ can be painted with ease. Also, because of the high sensitivity of the Microbit on your hand it becomes an exercise of creative relaxation and concentration if ones want to be able to paint a ‘realistic’ galaxy.

LZRBIT becomes a unique tool of expression offering to the media artist a new and distinct style.

## How to use the LZRBIT?

* Get a BBC Microbit
* Download this firmware to your Microbit.
* Use ONLY with Google Chrome.
* Use the PAIR MICROBIT button for pairing devices.
* The microbit ‘flat’ on one of both hands aligns the brush at the center of the screen (x=0, y=0).
* Press the POINT checkbox to draw points, and adjust its parameters.
* Press the LINE checkbox to draw lines, and adjust its parameters.
* Press the CURVE checkbox to draw bezier curves, and adjust its parameters.
* Use the microbit x,y,z axis to draw on the canvas by rotating them.
* Use the RESET button to reset your design.
* Use the SAVE button to save your design.

## Future versions

In future versions we want to add other sensors to drive the drawing app, like:

> NextMind API - A non invasive human brain interface.
