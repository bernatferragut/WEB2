# CREATING A RARE BITCOIN NFT

## What is an NFT?

The project presents 10 pieces of media ART reflecting my personal understanding on a sequence of OUT OF THE BODY EXPERIENCES-OBE I had at a young age. These experiences helped me to express myself through the digital arts because of its power to create and express the realm of the non physical reality.

As an advance of the future exhibition I present some of the first tested images on poster format.

> Buying an NFT means purchasing a hacker-resistant, public proof of ownership over a specific digital asset.

## HODL21 NFT series

The HODL21 NFT series is a formed by 3 different and distinct prints inspired by Satoshi’s Nakamoto invention: The Bitcoin.

The unique prints are inspired by the religious 12th century Europe. The inspiration comes from the father of modern computer science, the seminal Ramon Llull who got illuminated with the idea of building a ‘Machine of Truth’ and 700 years after his vision, passing through Leibniz, Boole and Alan Turing was materialized by Satoshi Nakamoto’s invention of the Bitcoin Protocol to store and share value in a decentralized way.

The prints show the illumination of Bitcoin and have distinct symbols all the crypto community understands and share: “B” for Bitcoin, “21” for the 21 million coins and the blockchain represented by the series of “0”s and “1”s at the bottom of the print.

The main name of the prints it’s “HODL” and all of them are supported by pure math with the latin inscription “vires in numeris”, or the truth lies in numbers.

Any crypto fan will be delighted for having one of these ‘one of a kind’ pieces of Art inspired by the greatest of our modern Saints: Satoshi.

## Choosing the right NFT platform to Mint your Art : Metaplex

Because of high fees to create the NFTs on the Ethereum network we have found the [Solana Network](https://solana.com/) being a far better alternative for creating NFTs at a fraction of the cost.

[Metaplex](https://www.metaplex.com/) empowers creators and brands to build a direct relationship with their audiences. Ultra-fast NFTs with insanely low minting fees, only possible on Solana.
