# CREATING A RARE BITCOIN NFT

## What is an NFT?

An NFT is a record on a cryptocurrency’s blockchain (an immutable ledger that can record more than just virtual coins) that represents pieces of digital media. Invented a few years ago, it can link not only to art but also to text, videos or bits of code. Promoters of NFTs claim that they solve a thorny problem with digital art: how to own an original. For creators who freely upload their work or sell it as identical copies, the concept of an original is difficult to pin down. Exclusivity is impossible to enforce when digital files can be shared freely on the internet. But collectors want the cachet that comes with having an exclusive claim on an artwork. This is where NFTs fit in.

> Buying an NFT means purchasing a hacker-resistant, public proof of ownership over a specific digital asset.



## HODL21 NFT series

The HODL21 NFT series is a formed by 3 different and distinct prints inspired by Satoshi’s Nakamoto invention: The Bitcoin.

The unique prints are inspired by the religious 12th century Europe. The inspiration comes from the father of modern computer science, the seminal Ramon Llull who got illuminated with the idea of building a ‘Machine of Truth’ and 700 years after his vision, passing through Leibniz, Boole and Alan Turing was materialized by Satoshi Nakamoto’s invention of the Bitcoin Protocol to store and share value in a decentralized way.

This first print shows the illumination of Satoshi with the symbols: “B” for Bitcoin and “21” for the 21 million coins will be printed on the blockchain network.

The second print shows the illumination of Satoshi with the symbols: [“sat”](https://satsymbol.com/) for satoshi and “100 000 000” for the 100Million division every Bitcoin is divided by.

The third print shows the illumination of Anatoly Yakovenko with the symbols: "sol" the local coin of the solana network and "proof of history" the invention of Mr.Yakovenko making this L1 solution the fastest and most scalable blockchain at this moment in time. The third print is dedicated to the Solana Network which allowed the creation of the NFTs thanks to its fast and low fees: Big Thank You!

Any crypto fan will be delighted for having one of these ‘one of a kind’ pieces of Art inspired by the greatest of our modern Saints: Satoshi.

## Choosing the right NFT platform to Mint your Art

Because of high fees to create the NFTs on the Ethereum network we have found the [Solana Network](https://solana.com/) being a far better alternative for creating NFTs at a fraction of the cost.

[Metaplex](https://www.metaplex.com/) empowers creators and brands to build a direct relationship with their audiences. Ultra-fast NFTs with insanely low minting fees, only possible on Solana.

Metplaplex has a special product for creating NFTs called [Holaplex](https://builder.holaplex.com/) allows to create NFTs in a simple manner at low cost. We have created the page hodl21 and here are the resulst of our first public auction on the Solana Network!

Here you can see the results of the first Hodl21 website Market Maker!=> [HODL21 website](https://hodl21.holaplex.com/#/artworks)
