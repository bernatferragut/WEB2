# 2020 Art Exhibition

The project presents 10 pieces of media ART reflecting my personal understanding on a sequence of OUT OF THE BODY EXPERIENCES-OBE I had at a young age. These experiences helped me to express myself through the digital arts because of its power to create and express the realm of the non physical reality.

Here I present some of the first tested images on poster format.

## Prototypes

## Art on Blockchain

The different pieces of Art will be exposed in a set of physycal galleries but most importantly through the EOS blockchain. The [EOS blockchain](https://eos.io/) and it’s different sidechains allows for the first time to timestamp your digital art and proofstamp each peace of art on an immutable transparent ledger on a Blockchain. EOS has been chosen because of it’s proven innovation, speed and scalability. For the first time Digital Art will become ‘Physical’ trhough real proof of ownership.

## Creating the source of vibration

The conclusions presented through these 10 pieces of art will propose to the audience a new direction and light in how to live a better life as human beings. The exhibition opens the possibility of the immortality of the human soul and it’s consequences while being alive in this world.

At the heart of the project we want to show a a vibrational machine which will produce visual sinusoidal energy similar to what is in the west called Kundalini energy.
