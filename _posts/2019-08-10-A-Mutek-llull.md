# Project
Project proposal for the Mutek festival (Montreal, 2019) dedicated to [Ramon Llull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramon_Llull), pioneer of computational thinking

## Performance
* This project proposes an audiovisual performance of approximately 30 minutes where a limited number of settings carefully calibrated are manipulated to generate the nine-part A/V work. The minimal and experimental aesthetic wants itself to be accessible as well as transcendent. Musically, the performance is inspired by the minimal techno, ambient and dub currents

* One of the authors goal is to align with the transparency philosophy of Open Source. This is why manipulations will be captured and projected to offer viewers the chance to perceive the effect of the manual interventions affecting both the sounds they hear and the shapes they see. We feel this approach is often overlooked by many artists. At the same time, it is one of the innovative aspects of this particular project

## Ramon Llull
Still today, Llull inspires a large number of creators working in multiple fields (visual arts, music, philosophy, politics, etc.). Amongst other things, the combinatorial and algorithmic principles developed by Llull have played a fundamental role in the evolution of human thought. Llull’s work has certainly fostered all kinds of technological advances that led to the digital and artistic revolution in which we live today

## Concept
* Llul suggests the use of reasoning to achieve “perfection”
* This quest is symbolized by the 9-level knowledge staircase
* The authors proposes a musical experience through these different stages
* Each scene contains a different question that invites the viewer to reason

## Structure
This introduction to creating Generative Art with p5JS course is divided into:

* Dot class abstraction
* dot object creation
* dot animation basics
* dot sliders
* dot - row
* dot - matrix
* dot - experiments
